# Why SneakyHub Exists?

We love to help out smaller developers who are just getting grips with things and we would love to see them grow and work on their projects without the issues of having to pay for a server or worry about not having enough money to support their projects so we take the stress off you by making sure you do not have to worry about finances. We don't expect anyone to pay us to host their projects but we do accept donations to help us with our monthly out-goings. We do not push people to donate or give back to the community but we are there for you! What this means is that we have a place where all developers big or small can interact with each other so that not only do you all have a common ground to talk and you share common interests but we also have places for you to offer your development skills in our Dev Market area within our discord. Allowing you to potentially get paid for your skills. Anyways we hope to grow to get more developers on our network. We want a loving development community who helps others out within the communmity!
